# OpenZitiSamples

This project contains sample applications that will work with an OpenZiti overlay.

You will need a valid identity file for these samples to function properly. The samples
come with setup scripts that leverage the `ziti` CLI to setup the overlay for testing.

If you do not have the `ziti` CLI, you can quickly install it by running a single 
powershell command:
```
iex(iwr -Uri https://get.openziti.io/quick/getZiti.ps1)
```

# Enrollment Demo
To run the enrollment demo, run `setup-scripts\enrollment.ps1`

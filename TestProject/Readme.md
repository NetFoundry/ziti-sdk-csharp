## Test Project

This project exists to simply use as a test project for the OpenZiti.NET SDK. It's
much easier to run the samples when refernced directly, which is what this project
does.

It exists separately, to allow for the sample project to refer to the released NuGet
package. If you want to run the samples, modify the "to-be-published" API, you would
use this project.
